# Hugging Face Data Summarization ðŸ¤—


###  Data Summarization âŒ—

This is a NLP technique and it is basically of 2 types:
- Extractive
   - Easy to achieve
   - Less CPU Consumption
   - NLTK Library

- Abstractive
   - Difficult to achieve
   - More CPU Consumption
   - Transformers and Pipelines

### Transformer Package - Hugging Face

The Hugging Face transformers package is an immensely popular python library provided pre-trained models that are extraordinarly useful for Natural Language Processing(NLP). And it is supported by both PyTorch and Tensorflow

- **Transformer** : transformer is an algorithm that can change one DataFrame into other DataFrame
- **Pipeline** : A pipeline chains multiple transformers and estimators together to estimate an ML workflow
- **Estimator** : An estimator is an algorithm that can fit on a DataFrame to produce a transformer
